## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- The project development involves first defining the basic requirements, quickly prototyping, then progressing through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development, with ongoing testing for a streamlined process.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- Programming languages: HTML, CSS, JS

## :sob: Lessons learnt
Reflecting on the development of the Tic Tac Toe game, a key takeaway would be the importance of beginning with a minimal viable product (MVP) rather than overthinking the initial stages.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this:
- Incorporate Animations
- Implement Sound Effects
- Introduce Single Player Mode
